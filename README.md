# Connect-N Game
## Introduction
This is a program I had to create for my Programming 2 class at Heritage College. The Connect-N game is a two-player game where players take turns dropping pieces into a vertical grid. The goal is to be the first to get a certain number of their pieces (the "N" in Connect-N) in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
## Features
The Connect-N game includes the following features:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game is implemented using Java Swing, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- Game Board and Piece Placement: The game board is displayed, and players can click on the columns to drop their pieces.
- Win Condition and Draw Detection: The game can detect when a player has won by getting N pieces in a row, as well as when the game ends in a draw.
- Save and Load Game: Players can save the current game state and load it later to continue playing.
- Undo Move: Players can undo their previous move.
- Help and About Information: The game provides access to help and information about the game.
- Sound Effects: The game includes sound effects for various actions, such as placing a piece, winning, and drawing.
## How to Run the Game
- Ensure you have Java (JRE 17+) installed on your system.
- Unzip the Connect-N zip folder in your desired location.
- Run command "java -jar ConnectNFrame.jar" or use the windows launcher (start.bat)
